# Individual-Difference-in-Structural-connectivity

These are the codes that are used in the paper 'Individual Variability in Structural Connectivity Architecture of the Human Brain across the Middle-aged and Old Adult'. Most of functions used in this repository are imported from a python library 'research_toolbox' (https://github.com/forwho/research_toolbox), which I developed for facilating scientific research.
